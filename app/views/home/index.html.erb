      <h2>Welcome to Niki & Jazmin</h2>
      <p>Niki and Jazmin are two little twin girls. Come and meet them via short stories based on real-life events. We beleive that these can happen in any kid’s life. Read our stories from our books and play with us in our iPad applications.</p>

    <p>As a mother of twin girls I felt that it would be such a great gift for my daughters to write children's book about the stories from their life - as a nice memory from their childhood. They very often ask me now - at age 4 - “Mommy, tell us about your childhood, tell us some stories what did you do as a child!” And even though I have a lot of lovely memories I don't remember too much from the times I was in their age. I hope I can help them a little bit with these stories.</p>
    
    <p>Adding a little bit of spice to the stories I also created interactive books and several iPad applications with Niki & Jazmin. I have got a lot of feedback from my kids what they like and what they dislike in certain games. I try to combine those and make the application for their taste.</p>
    
    <p>I believe that the stories I write and the applications I make can help other kids to learn new things and they might even find some events familiar, similar to their life.</p>
    
    <p>I hope you will enjoy the stories of Niki and Jazmin as much as I was creating those!</p>
