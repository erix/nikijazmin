      title: Our Story
      text: |
        As a mother of twin girls I felt that it would be such a great gift for my daughters to write children's book about the stories from their life - as a nice memory from their childhood. They very often ask me now - at age 4 - “Mommy, tell us about your childhood, tell us some stories what did you do as a child!” And even though I have a lot of lovely memories I don't remember too much from the times I was in their age. I hope I can help them a little bit with these stories.

        Adding a little bit of spice to the stories I also created interactive books and several iPad applications with Niki & Jazmin. I have got a lot of feedback from my kids what they like and what they dislike in certain games. I try to combine those and make the application for their taste.

        I believe that the stories I write and the applications I make can help other kids to learn new things and they might even find some events familiar, similar to their life.

        I hope you will enjoy the stories of Niki and Jazmin as much as I was creating those!
